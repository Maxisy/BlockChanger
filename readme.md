A plugin that changes a block above your head to bedrock. It's made for fun, not to play a normal survival game, but when you want, it's kindda challenge :).

Commands:
/startblockchange - starts changing blocks;
/stopblockchange - stops changing blocks;
/blockchanger info - shows a list of commands;
/blockchanger reload - reloads config.yml.

Config:
In config.yml you can edit prefix.
